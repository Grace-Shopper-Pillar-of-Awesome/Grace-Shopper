      "The Andromeda Galaxy (IPA: /ænˈdrɒmɪdə/), also known as Messier 31, M31, or NGC 224 and originally the Andromeda Nebula (see below), is a barred spiral galaxy approximately 2.5 million light-years (770 kiloparsecs) from Earth and the nearest major galaxy to the Milky Way.[6] The galaxy's name stems from the area of Earth's sky in which it appears, the constellation of Andromeda, which itself is named after the Ethiopian (or Phoenician) princess who was the wife of Perseus in Greek mythology.\nThe virial mass of the Andromeda Galaxy is of the same order of magnitude as that of the Milky Way, at 1 trillion solar masses (2.0×1042 kilograms). The mass of either galaxy is difficult to estimate with any accuracy, but it was long thought that the Andromeda Galaxy is more massive than the Milky Way by a margin of some 25% to 50%. This has been called into question by a 2018 study that cited a lower estimate on the mass of the Andromeda Galaxy,[10] combined with preliminary reports on a 2019 study estimating a higher mass of the Milky Way.[11][12] The Andromeda Galaxy has a diameter of about 220,000 ly (67 kpc), making it the largest member of the Local Group in terms of extension, if not mass.[citation needed]\nThe number of stars contained in the Andromeda Galaxy is estimated at one trillion (1×1012), or roughly twice the number estimated for the Milky Way.[13][needs update]\nThe Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies are expected to collide in around 4-5 billion years,[14] merging to form a giant elliptical galaxy[15] or a large lenticular galaxy.[16] With an apparent magnitude of 3.4, the Andromeda Galaxy is among the brightest of the Messier objects,[17] making it visible to the naked eye from Earth on moonless nights,[18] even when viewed from areas with moderate light pollution.",

Most other galaxies associated with the Sculptor Group are only weakly gravitationally bound to this core",

    description:
      "The Sombrero Galaxy (also known as Messier Object 104, M104 or NGC 4594) is a spiral galaxy[4] in the constellation borders of Virgo and Corvus, being about 9.55 megaparsecs (31.1 million light-years)[2] from our galaxy, within the local supercluster. It has a diameter of approximately 15 kiloparsecs (49,000 light-years),[5] 0.3x times the size of the Milky Way. It has a bright nucleus, an unusually large central bulge, and a prominent dust lane in its outer disk, which is viewed almost edge-on. The dark dust lane and the bulge give this galaxy the appearance of a sombrero hat. Astronomers initially thought that the halo was small and light, indicative of a spiral galaxy, but the Spitzer Space Telescope found that the dust ring around the Sombrero Galaxy is larger and more massive than previously thought, indicative of a giant elliptical galaxy.[6] The galaxy has an apparent magnitude of +8.0,[5] making it easily visible with amateur telescopes, and it is considered by some authors to be the galaxy with the highest absolute magnitude within a radius of 10 megaparsecs of the Milky Way.[3] Its large bulge, its central supermassive black hole, and its dust lane all attract the attention of professional astronomers.",

In the mid-19th century, Anglo-Irish astronomer Lord Rosse identified spiral structures within the galaxy, making this one of the first galaxies in which such structure was identified",
